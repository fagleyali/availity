## 1.	My proudest professional achievements are to create DASBoard, Kids-meetup, Sonargaon(Travel App). First of all in the case of DASBoard, I planned the layout, implemented some functionalities which are very precise and performance oriented. Secondly Kids-meetupâ€™s concept is very nice. It is specifically for social network among neighborhood kids whose parents are busy with their work.
## 2.	I like a blog recently regarding involvement of teens in any Mathematics and Algorithm program, online courses or any competition which will grow them up in a very confident manner rather than to complete 12 grades or enrollment in higher studies. 
## 3.	Availity creates your healthcare reports and shots schedule.
